1. Project Context & Objective
Company: Code Labs AB (Stockholm, Sweden). Industry: Specialized IT Consultancy (DevOps, Cloud Platform, SRE) + Internal Product Incubator (GreenTech). Target Audience: Senior DevOps Engineers, Cloud Architects, Fullstack Developers (looking for a new home), and potential Clients (CTOs, Engineering Managers). Goal: Create website copy and structure that clarifies what we do (high-end consultancy) and how we recruit (human-centric, upskilling-focused).

2. Brand Voice & Tone
Authentic & Personal: "Hippt och personligt" (Hip and personal). Use "We" and "You." Avoid corporate jargon.

Expert Level: Speak the language of senior engineers (Terraform, Kubernetes, GitOps). Don't dumb it down.

Passion-Driven: Convey excitement about "Code Days," hackathons, and the "Greener Future."

3. Core Content Pillars (The "What")
Pillar A: The "Code Labs Standard" (Consultancy Services)
Context: We don't just fill seats. We modernize infrastructure.

Platform Engineering: Building self-service platforms using Kubernetes (AKS/EKS/GKE), Rancher, and OpenShift.

Infrastructure as Code: Moving clients from manual ops to fully automated Terraform/OpenTofu & Ansible workflows.

Cloud Migration: Architecting complex moves from On-Prem to Cloud, or AWS to Azure, with a focus on zero-downtime and security.

Modernization: Refactoring legacy systems (monoliths) into scalable microservices or serverless functions.

Pillar B: The Recruitment Journey (The Process)
Context: A transparent, safe, and investing process.

Step 1: Discovery Call. A casual "chemistry check" with a recruiter to discuss values.

Step 2: Founder Deep Dive. Technical discussion with the company owners. We value engineering leadership.

Step 3: Team Sync. Meet your future colleagues (the "vibe check"). Transparency is key.

Step 4: The Offer. We commit to you before we have the assignment.

Step 5: The Launchpad (Crucial USP). We find the right assignment. If you lack a specific skill (e.g., GCP), we upskill you on our dime before you start.

Pillar C: Culture & "Greener Future"
Context: Purpose beyond the paycheck.

The Mission: We use our consultancy revenue to fund internal products that fight climate change (Green Digital Finance, Carbon Accounting).

Code Days: Paid time dedicated to internal dev, learning new tech, or hacking on our green products.

Community: Flat hierarchy, regular dinners, hackathons, and trips (e.g., Fjäderholmarna).

9. Comprehensive Data Analysis & Source Integration
This section ensures that all requirements from the research snippets have been integrated into the strategy.

9.1. Analysis of Missing/Broken Links
The user provided links  that were inaccessible. This reinforces the urgency of the request. The current web presence is likely fragile or non-existent. The new report must assume it is building from "Ground Zero," necessitating a complete content strategy rather than just "tweaks."   

9.2. Integration of Third-Party Data
Creditsafe/Allabolag : Confirms Code Labs AB is established (2016) and profitable enough to support "bench time." This financial stability should be subtly reassured in the "Offer" section of the recruitment page.   

LinkedIn/Demando : These were the richest sources for culture ("Hippt och personligt"). The "Code Days" concept found here is the strongest retention tool identified and has been elevated to a core pillar in the report.   

9.3. The "Internal Product" Mystery
The snippets revealed confusion between "Code Labs AB" (Sweden), "KODE Labs" (Detroit - Smart Buildings), and "Codelabs" (Madrid - Games).

Critical Action: The new website MUST differentiate. The "About Us" section needs to explicitly state: "Proudly founded in Stockholm, focused on the Nordic market." It should perhaps clarify, "Not to be confused with KODE Labs Detroit," or simply rely on strong local SEO (Stockholm address: Södra Kungsvägen 68) to avoid candidate confusion.

9.4. The "Upskill" Mechanism
The user’s specific inclusion of "uppskill candidate if needed" in the 6-step process is a direct response to the "Talent Shortage."

Market Context: In 2026, finding a "Perfect Match" senior engineer is nearly impossible.

The Strategy: Code Labs is effectively saying, "We hire for 80% fit and train the remaining 20%." This is a massive competitive advantage against rigid HR departments at larger firms. The report advises making this a headline feature.

10. Conclusion and Forward Outlook
The transformation of codelabs.se from a static brochure into a dynamic recruitment engine requires a shift in narrative focus. The "product" Code Labs is selling is not just consultancy services; it is career acceleration for engineers and innovation reliability for clients.

By leveraging the specific technical credibility extracted from the CVs—the mastery of Kubernetes, the leadership in Cloud Migration, and the Fullstack versatility—the website can filter for high-quality candidates automatically. "Junior" applicants will self-select out when they see the depth of "Infrastructure as Code" discussed, while "Senior" applicants will be drawn to the complexity.

Simultaneously, the "Human-Centric" recruitment process, particularly the "Hire-then-Assign" and "Upskill" models, addresses the primary anxieties of the modern consultant: stability and stagnation. Coupled with the "Greener Future" mission, which satisfies the need for purpose, Code Labs AB has all the components of a market-leading employer brand.

The prompt file provided in Section 8 is the key to unlocking this. It is structured to force the AI to generate content that is specific, technical, and culturally accurate, bridging the gap between the "hidden gem" Code Labs is today and the "destination employer" it aims to become.
