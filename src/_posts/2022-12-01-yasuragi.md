Yasuragi is one of Stockholm's most popular spa facilities and is known for its
luxurious Japanese atmosphere. Recently, we at Code Labs visited this wonderful
place to relax and enjoy an evening full of bathing, meditation and good food.

After checking in at Yasuragi, we were greeted by the soothing sound of running
water and the scent of Japanese incense candles.

The facility offers a variety of different baths and saunas, each with its own
unique character and purpose. We started in the traditional Japanese onsen,
which is a natural hot spring bath that is said to have healing properties for
both body and soul.

After the hot bath, we moved on to the cold pool, which provided a refreshing
contrast and helped activate our circulation. The experience was both
invigorating and relaxing at the same time.

After the spa treatments, we enjoyed a delicious dinner at Yasuragi's
restaurant, which serves traditional Japanese cuisine with a modern twist. The
food was both beautifully presented and incredibly tasty.

The evening at Yasuragi was exactly what we needed to recharge our batteries and
strengthen team spirit. It was the perfect way to end a busy period and prepare
for the challenges ahead.

We can highly recommend Yasuragi to anyone looking for a relaxing and
rejuvenating experience. It's a place where you can really disconnect from
everyday stress and focus on your wellbeing.
