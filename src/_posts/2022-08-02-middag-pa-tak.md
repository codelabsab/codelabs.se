Summer vacation is coming to an end and we felt it was time to meet up for some
dinner.

The destination was Tak, which is located at Brunkebergstorget.

We met on the rooftop and had a pre-drink and then went down to the restaurant.

We kept it simple and went with the three-course menu. Some sake paired
perfectly with the food :)
