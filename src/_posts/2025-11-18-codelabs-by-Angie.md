## MEGA MEGA fun!

This was MEGA mega fun!
I got five guys to try Megaformer Pilates, probably not something they would have tested on their own.
We dared to try, experimented our way through it, and WOW was it fun!
I don’t think I’ve ever laughed that much during a workout before.


## Megaformer Pilates

Megaformer Pilates!  
This month’s Code Labs activity was up to me to come up with, and I like challenging myself and others, even though I was a bit nervous about how everyone would react to my idea this time.
There’s so much value in trying something new together, strengthening the great team spirit we have, month by month.


 We got a great Instructor at [The Place](https://www.theplacestockholm.se/signature-megaformer-class?gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=21026084539&gbraid=0AAAAA9S0e7WOZr892dD1OP1_VeeRpqQwR&gclid=CjwKCAiAz_DIBhBJEiwAVH2XwJRHuxSRshCaSjQpu-_rqaHk5e-13edUBLFAVKeAHowHoL71yjTTeRoCb0IQAvD_BwE).

There were lots of laughs and very sore muscles in the days after, totally WORTH it!


## Dinner

For dinner we went to a well-known steak restaurant [Teuf](https://teuf.se/)
Meat, fries, and Béarnaise sauce always hit the spot.

and a tasty chocolate dessert with a dash of olive oil and salt on top
