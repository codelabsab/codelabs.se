We at Code Labs love to compete. So I thought, what could be better than a
triathlon? After the battle, we went to a restaurant and had a good dinner.

## The Triathlon: A battle for honor and glory

Great honor and glory was at stake when we competed in a triathlon. We would be
challenged in three disciplines:

- Racing
- Shuffleboard
- Golf

## First discipline: Racing

![racing](/assets/blogg/bb_racing_2.jpg) We got to do racing in a simulator. It
was a challenge to stay on track and not crash into the other cars.

Results:

1. Pär 🥇
2. Tied between Kami and Tommy 🥈
3. Love 🥉

## Second discipline: Shuffleboard

![shuffleboard](/assets/blogg/bb_shuffle.jpg) Now it was time for shuffleboard.
It was an even battle where everyone had a chance to win.

Tommy, Kami and Love were all on the same points after they were done. By the
skin of my teeth, I managed to win by 1 point.

Results:

1. Pär 🥇
2. Tied between Kami, Tommy and Love 🥈

## Third discipline: Golf

Now it was time for the last discipline. We were going to play golf. The
competition was to hit as far as possible. 3 shots per round where the best shot
counted. We played 2 rounds.

Results:

1. Pär (398 meters) 🥇
2. Tommy (352 meters) 🥈
3. Kami (323 meters) 🥉🥓
4. Love (307 meters)

## Prize ceremony

After all the blood, sweat and tears, we had reached the following result:

1. Pär 🥇
2. Tommy 🥈
3. Kami 🥉
4. Love

## Restaurant Björk: Bar and Grill

After the competition and a quick 🍺 we hurried on to the restaurant
[Björk Bar & Grill](https://bjorkbarochgrill.se/).

A little cocktail 🍹 and a good entrecote 🥩 was the highlight there.

I give the evening 4 out of 5 approved pull requests. It was a wonderful evening
with competition and good dinner.
