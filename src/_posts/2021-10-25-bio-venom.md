Time to go to the movies!

It was between Venom and Eternals and it became, unfortunately, Venom. Mostly
because the timing worked best. However, the movie cannot be recommended!

We mostly sat there trying to hold back laughter ðŸ˜‚ Really bad movie!

Venom gets 1 out of 5 approved pull requests for being unintentionally funny!
