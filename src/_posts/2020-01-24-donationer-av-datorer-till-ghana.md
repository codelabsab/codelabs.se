Code Labs, in collaboration with Avida Finans, has donated 30 laptops and 10
computer screens to the Technical University in Takoradi, Ghana. The computers,
which were about to be recycled, could instead be donated to the university
students, improving education and being good for the environment.

With the help of a former colleague in the industry, Code Labs learned that a
number of computers were no longer being used. A friend of ours at Code Labs
named Sanusi was born in Takoradi and has a broad network in Ghana. With the
help of hardware from Avida Finans and our network and donation, we were able to
send everything down via cargo ship.

Very much appreciated by both the university and its students.
