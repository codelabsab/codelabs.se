## Change of plans

I had planned for us to play table tennis, but the venue I had booked called and said: 

"Sorry, they just carried away the table tennis table and we don't have any left." 😒

This happened two days before our event, and I had already the restaurant booked. Fortunately I found the pool hall that was close by.

## Pool

Table tennis out - pool in!

We met at [Jolo](https://jolo.se/biljard/), where we played pool and had a few beers.

Pool was fun, but I was more keen on table tennis. Maybe next time!

## Dinner

After a couple of hours of pool, we went to [La Esquina de la Tonteria](https://laesquina.se/) for dinner.

Tapas is always a two edged sword for me - I love it, but it's always so hard to decide what to order. 😂

The food was good and the atmosphere lively.

The dessert was the highlight of the evening for me - This delicious version of a cheese cake 🤤

As always, it's great to hang out with the team outside of work. Looking forward to the next event!
