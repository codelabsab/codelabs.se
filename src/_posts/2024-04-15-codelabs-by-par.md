## Bowling

We met at [Birka bowling](https://birkabowling.se/), a great place where we've
been before. ![bowling](/assets/blogg/bowling_1.jpg)

It was really fun! We played two series and it was a close fight for victory.

Tommy was the strongest and had the most points of all of us after two played
series!

## Dinner

After bowling, we went to restaurant [Portal](https://www.portalrestaurant.se/)
where we had booked a table.

We were all very satisfied with the food, really good!

As usual, it was a nice evening with the Code Labs gang! üôè
