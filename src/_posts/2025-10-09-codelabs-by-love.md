## New Memories

I wanted to plan something fun for the team - something we hadn't done before. After a bit of searching (and rejecting a few questionable ideas), I stumbled on something unexpected... and a little bit dangerous. Perfect!

## Axe Throwing

Axe throwing!  
I found a spot in the city that offered this unusual but surprisingly fun experience.

After some quick safety instructions at [Max Axe](https://madaxe.se/), we were finally allowed to let loose and test our inner Vikings.

It turned out to be *way* more satisfying than expected. We learned a few different throwing techniques - the underhand throw was definitely the crowd favorite - and before long, things got competitive.

## Dinner

After an hour of intense throwing and a few bullseyes, we walked over to [Yono Sabo](https://www.yonosabo.se/) for some well-earned tacos.

I love tacos - and these were honestly among the best I've ever had.

We also went all in with a meat platter that didn't disappoint.

All in all, it was a thrilling evening full of laughter, competition, and great food.  
10/10 - would throw axes and eat tacos again. 🌮🪓
