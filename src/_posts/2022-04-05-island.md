Now that the pandemic is over (or at least less noticeable), we decided it was
time for a company trip. Some time to hang out and get to know each other
better, but also to relax and have fun.

On March 31st, therefore, 5 out of 6 Code Labs consultants set off for
Reykjavik, Iceland. None of us had been there before and it became a trip we
won't soon forget.

**_Food:_** Who would have thought that Iceland had so much to offer in terms of
food? Almost all the food we ate was great, but the favorite for all of us was
probably lamb. Seems reasonable considering how many sheep live here.

**_Nature:_** Iceland's nature is absolutely incredible. We had the opportunity
to experience several different types of natural phenomena during our stay.
Everything from geysers and waterfalls to lava caves and volcanic craters.

**_People:_** The Icelanders we met were incredibly friendly and helpful.
Despite the language barrier (most speak excellent English), we felt very
welcome.

## Day 1 - Arrival and first impressions

We landed in Reykjavik on a Thursday evening and were immediately struck by how
clean and organized everything seemed. After checking into our hotel, we went
out to explore the city center.

The first thing we noticed was how expensive everything was, but also how
beautiful the city was with its colorful houses and artistic graffiti.

## Day 2 - The Golden Circle

The second day we booked a tour of the famous Golden Circle. This is probably
Iceland's most popular tourist route and includes three main stops: Thingvellir
National Park, Geysir geothermal area and Gullfoss waterfall.

At Geysir we got to see the famous Strokkur which erupts every 5-10 minutes and
shoots water up to 40 meters high. It's an incredible sight that never gets old.

Gullfoss was absolutely magical. The power of the water and the mist that rises
create an almost mystical atmosphere.

## Day 3 - Lava caves and volcanic craters

The third day we explored some of Iceland's geological wonders. We visited
several lava caves and volcanic craters.

The lava caves were formed when lava flowed through underground tunnels and then
cooled. Walking through these caves felt like being on another planet.

The volcanic craters were equally impressive. Standing on the edge of a crater
and looking down into the depths gives you a real sense of the earth's power.

## Day 4 - Relaxation and departure

Our last day we spent relaxing and exploring more of Reykjavik before it was
time to head home.

## Summary

Iceland exceeded all our expectations. It's a country that offers incredible
nature experiences, good food and friendly people. We can highly recommend it as
a travel destination.

The trip also strengthened our team spirit and gave us many shared memories that
we will carry with us for a long time.
