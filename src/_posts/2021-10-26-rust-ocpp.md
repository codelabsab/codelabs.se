Code Labs has a great interest in electric cars - we all drive Tesla 🏎️

This means we also suffer from the problems with charging. This made us think
about how charging stations actually work and how the systems are built.

OCPP is a standard developed by ElaadNL and is the dominant standard in Europe.

Unfortunately, there was no lib in [rust](https://rust-lang.org) 🦀 which we are
big fans of. So we decided to write one ourselves and have now released it as
open source 🎉! Woho!

Released as a crate here: [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/rust-ocpp)

And the source code is available here:
[github](https://github.com/codelabsab/rust-ocpp)

```bash
➜ cargo build --release
    ...
    Finished release [optimized] target(s) in 15.72s
```

Whooohooo!
