Code Labs has joined the global initiative **Team Trees** together with Elon
Musk, MrBeast and many others to plant 20 million trees by 2020.

For every dollar donated, one tree is planted. The trees are planted by the
**Arbor Day Foundation** in forests that need restoration.

This is an important environmental initiative that we are proud to support.
Every tree makes a difference for our planet's future.
