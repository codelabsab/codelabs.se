It was time for our autumn kick-off after a long time of working from home,
vaccines that weren't available to everyone and restrictions. Finally we could
meet and socialize physically instead of our digital after works that we had
during the pandemic.

We met at the office at KG10 where Tommy and Joatin went through our internal
project that they had been working on lately.

The project is secret right now but is a product that we hope will help the
world become more environmentally friendly in an easier way.

After this we went and had lunch and then took a taxi out to Bromma to do
Virtual Reality and play Shuffleboard at VR Center.

Virtual Reality was extremely fun! The hardware was Oculus Rift headsets
connected to an HP computer that you wore like a backpack.

You walked around in a large room where everyone was in the same VR world
together and did challenges together.

Several of us also have Oculus Quest headsets that we use for development and it
was fun to experience other manufacturers' solutions.

We also took the opportunity to play some shuffleboard while we waited where we
divided into two teams.

Then it was time to head out to restaurant Ekstedt for a 7-course dinner with
accompanying wine package.

It was a great evening with lots of laughter, tech talk and good food!
